This website is only available on intranet of the company Rede Bahia.
This project aimed to give totally freedom for the editors in fill the website with contents. Tree models were set where the editors can create, update and delete. We configured a login authentication system with 4 levels of acess:
1. Ordinary user: doesn't have acess the journalism reports;
2. Reader: can fully read content;
3. Editor: can manipulate the website in order to make all editions even of carroussel;
4. Superuser: have all control of website;
